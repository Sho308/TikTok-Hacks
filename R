# TikLite — Demo TikTok Clone (Web → APK)

This repository contains a demo TikTok-like web app (HTML/CSS/JS).  
When pushed to `main`, GitHub Actions will run and build a Cordova debug APK automatically.

## How to use
1. Make sure files are present: `index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`, `dp.png`, `sample.mp4`.
2. Push to GitHub `main` branch.
3. Go to Actions → "Build Cordova APK" → Click the latest run → Wait for job finish.
4. Download artifact `tiklite-apk` (app-debug.apk) from the run page.

## Notes
- This is a local demo. All likes/views/followers are stored locally in browser storage when running as WebApp or inside the APK.
- If sample.mp4 is large, consider using a small test video.
